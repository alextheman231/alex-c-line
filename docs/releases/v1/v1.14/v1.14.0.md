# v1.14.0 (Minor Release)

**Status**: Released

This is a new minor release of the `alex-c-line` package. It introduces new features in a backwards-compatible way that should require very little refactoring, if any. Please read below the description of changes.

## Description of Changes

- Adds a few extra flags to the `pre-commit` command:
    - `--no-build`: Allows you to skip the build step.
        - Useful for repositories that don't compile their code into a `dist` folder or equivalent.
    - `--allow-unstaged`: Allows the hook to run even if there are unstaged changes.
        - The default behaviour remains the same in that it will exit early if there are no staged changes.
        - The skip is helpful when actually running pre-commits as a hook to prevent unnecessary runs that disrupt the workflow, but for those using it as a quick 'check everything' command, this is where it really shines.
