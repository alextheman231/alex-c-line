# v1.18.3 (Patch Release)

**Status**: Released

This is a new patch release of the `alex-c-line` package. It fixes issues with the package in a way that should require no refactoring. Please read below the description of changes.

## Description of Changes

- Include the templates in the files.
    - Really what's happening is that it tries to look for the templates in the root of the folder in `node_modules`. In order to ensure that gets included, we must include it in the files field in `package.json` so it gets included along with dist.
