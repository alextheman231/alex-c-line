## Description of Changes

- Hopefully fix the update notifications.
    - The old implementation where we just do `updateNotifier().notify()` has been restored, as that was the last working implementation.
    - I am also keeping the artwork around as I don't think the exact string was the thing breaking it.

## Additional Notes

- In the near future, I plan to move the update notifications in-house so that `alex-c-line` controls them fully, rather than needing to use `update-notifier`.
- This makes it easier for me to test the logic to ensure it behaves exactly how I want it to, and it also lets us take better advantage of existing `alex-c-line` tools, such as the caching/config system.
- This may take some time, though, but I think it will be worth it.
