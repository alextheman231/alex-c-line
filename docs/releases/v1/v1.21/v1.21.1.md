# v1.21.1 (Patch Release)

**Status**: Released

<!-- alex-c-line-start-release-summary -->
This is a new patch release of the `alex-c-line` package. It fixes issues with the package and should require no refactoring. Please read the description of changes below.
<!-- alex-c-line-end-release-summary -->

## Description of Changes

- Fix a bug where we couldn't use a local version of `alex-c-line` unless it was in `package.json`.
    - `alex-c-line` does not need to be in `package.json` for it to work given that it references the dist of the local repository.
- Change `program.error()` to `DataError` for configuration-related failures where appropriate.
    - I feel like this is more helpful when debugging config-related issues, as `program.error()` generally just tends to print the error message and leave it at that. `DataError` will provide more context to help you figure out what went wrong.

## Additional Notes

- Now that I've unblocked `alex-c-line` from being used locally, if you dare, try running `alex-c-line use-local-package alex-c-line -- use-local-package alex-c-line` and enjoy the recursion!
- Do I intend to error against that, though? Not really, I don't think it'd really be too harmful. Worst case is, you just Ctrl+C out of it and carry on with your day.
- Plus, it's just so cursed that I don't mind people doing it ironically, as long as it doesn't cause any severe issues, which I don't think it should.
