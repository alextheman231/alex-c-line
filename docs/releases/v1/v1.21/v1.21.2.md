## Description of Changes

- Fixes the giant `ExecaError`s that occur when local `alex-c-line` fails in `use-local-package`.
    - Previously, if the local `alex-c-line` runner failed, it would fail and give a giant `ExecaError`, which is not really ideal considering that it obscures the actual error from the runner. This has been fixed so that on our side, we just display a friendly program error below the stack trace.
    - Furthermore, there was an issue where running it with no arguments caused the help page to show and the error to be thrown. This change fixes this so that calling local `alex-c-line` with no arguments does not also throw a program error on our side.
- Adds extra checks for `package.json` usage.
    - If the name field in the repository `package.json` does not match what is in the private config/the provided argument, we throw an error. This ensures that the repository we're trying to refer to is in fact the intended package repository.
    - If `package.json` is missing from either, we also throw an error. This ensures that we don't try to swap out dependencies in a directory that is not actually an NPM project.
