# v1.19.1 (Patch Release)

**Status**: Released

This is a new patch release of the `alex-c-line` package. It fixes issues with the package in a way that should require no refactoring. Please read below the description of changes.

## Description of Changes

- Fixes a parsing bug in `create-pull-request-template`
    - That command relies on a parser to parse the options for the command.
    - In the case that we may pass, say, the Infrastructure options when the general options have been set, it will error as they still make it onto the object to parse as undefined.
    - To fix this, we need to use `removeUndefinedFromObject`, which was recently added to utility.

## Additional Notes

- See [utility v4.10.0](https://github.com/alextheman231/utility/releases/tag/v4.10.0) for more information about the mentioned helper.
