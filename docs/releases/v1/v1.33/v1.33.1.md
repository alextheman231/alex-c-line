## Description of Changes

- Create HTML templates so we can re-render the outdated table in `internal outdated-dependencies`
    - GitHub Actions doesn't really like it when we pass in the actual table from `pnpm outdated`, so we must reconstruct it ourselves.
    - I do this by making use of our templating system and recreating the table in HTML files first, as opposed to reconstructing the string. This allows us to format said files using Prettier and is just overall a better developer experience than having to work with stringly-typed HTML.
