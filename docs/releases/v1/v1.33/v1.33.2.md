## Description of Changes

- Return the literal `NO_OUTDATED_DEPENDENCIES_FOUND` if no outdated dependencies were found by `alex-c-line internal outdated-dependencies`
    - This allows us to skip comment creation after updating dependencies if there are no outdated dependencies remaining.
    - Note that I decided to use the `NO_OUTDATED_DEPENDENCIES_FOUND` message to signal this case as it's easier to check against that programatically than it is for, say, a human-readable error message or even an empty string.

## Additional Notes

- It's times like this where I wish we could have more semantic exit codes.
- Like, we could've had, say, exit code 0 generically meaning that the command succeeded with no side-effects applied, and then exit code 1 meaning succeeded with side effects applied or something like that, and then we'd be able to check that more rigourously rather than having to assert against a stringly-typed message.
