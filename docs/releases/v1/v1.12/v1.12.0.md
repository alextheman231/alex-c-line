# v1.12.0 (Minor Release)

**Status**: Released

This is a new minor release of the `alex-c-line` package. It introduces new features in a backwards-compatible way that should require very little refactoring, if any. Please read below the description of changes.

## Description of Changes

- Adds a `get-version-type` command.
    - This command returns the version type (`major`, `minor`, `patch`, etc.) for a given version number.
    - The `v` prefix is optional and is handled internally via VersionNumber from the utility package.

## Additional Notes

- This will most likely be used in some of my publish workflows in my GitHub Actions repository, where I am starting to look into GitHub Releases. As such, I need this so I can point the release creation to the path that I expect the release note to be in (`docs/releases/<version-type>/<version-number>`). The output of the command would fill in the `version-type`
- It'll be nice so that the release notes can also be accessible from the main repository page itself, rather than needing to go through `docs/releases` yourself every single time.
