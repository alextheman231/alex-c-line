# v1.23.1 (Patch Release)

<!-- alex-c-line-start-release-status -->
**Status**: Released
<!-- alex-c-line-end-release-status -->

<!-- alex-c-line-start-release-summary -->
This is a new patch release of the `alex-c-line` package. It fixes issues with the package and should require no refactoring. Please read the description of changes below.
<!-- alex-c-line-end-release-summary -->

## Description of Changes

- Fix a bug with `git-post-merge-cleanup` in rebase mode.
    - `currentBranch` was meant to be a template variable, but it was not. Hence the command failed.

## Additional Notes

- I mean, it didn't break **all** of `alex-c-line`, so the previous release note is still technically correct.
- It wasn't even `use-local-package` that broke either - it was `git-post-merge-cleanup`, and all just because I forgot to interpolate the variable when refactoring to tagged template...
- Whoops!
