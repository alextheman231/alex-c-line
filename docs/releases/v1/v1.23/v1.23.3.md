**Status**: Released

<!-- alex-c-line-start-release-summary -->
This is a new patch release of the `alex-c-line` package. It fixes issues with the package and should require no refactoring. Please read the description of changes below.
<!-- alex-c-line-end-release-summary -->

## Description of Changes

- Refactors all `ExecaError`s throughout the codebase to be wrapped and presented as `DataError`.
    - `DataError` is the more conventional error to use in my codebases.
    - Using it here instead of `ExecaError` allows us to more deliberately choose what the most important parts of the `ExecaError` are so that we don't have to surface every single property of `ExecaError`, of which there are many.

## Additional Notes

- I have also refactored this project's directory so that all commands and all utility helpers are grouped together.
- Eventually, I want to make the command call site mirror these directory changes. (so, instead of, for example, `alex-c-line create-release-note`, you'd use `alex-c-line template release-note create`)
- The above command-level change has not been implemented yet, however, so no need to worry about changing existing usage for now.
- Just bear in mind that I will eventually change this closer to the release of v2.
