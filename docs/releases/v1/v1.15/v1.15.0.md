# v1.15.0 (Minor Release)

**Status**: Released

This is a new minor release of the `alex-c-line` package. It introduces new features in a backwards-compatible way that should require very little refactoring, if any. Please read below the description of changes.

## Description of Changes

- Adds a `--repository-manager` flag to `pre-commit` command
    - This is needed in Neurosongs 2 so that we can add `--ui=stream` to all the commands being run to get rid of the weird terminal noise from entering/exiting interactive mode.

## Additional Notes

- This command is pretty neat as of now, but it will get neater in the near future.
- A v2 release of `alex-c-line` is currently being planned, and that will come around with a config rewrite, so that instead of `alex-c-line-config.json`, we support a flat config system similar to what ESLint already does.
- In this system, we'd be able to control more precisely what scripts get run and customise based on a wide range of configurable options.
- I think this would be a really nice feature once implemented, where instead of having to write pure Bash all the time, we can instead use a well-typed object and we can enable/disable specific behaviours without needing to worry about the specific implementation, but it'll still give enough control such that you can run functions within the config file in case you need dynamic behaviour when configuring.
- All of this will happen in v2, though, so stay tuned for the release note for that!
