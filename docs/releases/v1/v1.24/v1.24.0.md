This is a new minor release of the `alex-c-line` package. It introduces new features in a backwards-compatible way and should require very little refactoring, if any. Please read the description of changes below.

## Description of Changes

- Add ASCII art for `alex-c-line` under the `artwork` command.
    - You can also generate a PNG of the artwork using `--save-png [filePath]`, where `filePath` defaults to `artwork/alex-c-line.png`.
- Display the artwork in the update notifications.

## Additional Notes

- This artwork will also be used for the cover art of the theme song for the package, which is expected to come out either later this week or next week.
