# v1.19.2 (Patch Release)

**Status**: In progress

This is a new patch release of the `alex-c-line` package. It fixes issues with the package in a way that should require no refactoring. Please read below the description of changes.

## Description of Changes

- Adds the `infrastructureConfig` for re-use in the Infrastructure repository.
    - This was part of the motivation for adding the function support - it allows us to be able to run a function as part of the pre-commit steps, which I think is very cool!
    - Certainly beats doing it with Bash any time of day.
