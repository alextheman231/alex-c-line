# v1.17.3 (Patch Release)

**Status**: Released

This is a new patch release of the `alex-c-line` package. It fixes issues with the package in a way that should require no refactoring. Please read below the description of changes.

## Description of Changes

- Use `program.parseAsync()` rather than `program.parse()` to parse the command-line arguments.
    - According to the [Commander](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commander) docs, we're really supposed to be using `program.parseAsync()` if we have asynchronous action handlers, which in our case, we do.
    - As such, in order to achieve this, we must wrap the function around in an asynchronous arrow function that immediately gets called.
- Use the `@commander-js/extra-typings` package to get better type inference when developing.
    - Any command arguments and flags will be properly typed by TypeScript when using this package, as opposed to everything just being string like it was before. It makes parsing the command-line arguments so much easier.

## Additional Notes

- This should require no refactoring on your part. Most, if not, all commands should work exactly as they did before.
- In complete honesty, I'm not even sure if parseAsync will really make much of a difference, or if there even are any commands that would break with our old implementation.
- That said, it does seem to be the recommended pattern from Commander, so probably best to do it this way.
