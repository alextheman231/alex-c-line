# v1.17.3 (Patch Release)

**Status**: In progress

This is a new patch release of the `alex-c-line` package. It fixes issues with the package in a way that should require no refactoring. Please read below the description of changes.

## Description of Changes

- Use `program.parseAsync()` rather than `program.parse()` to parse the command-line arguments.
    - According to the [Commander](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commander) docs, we're really supposed to be using `program.parseAsync()` if we have asynchronous action handlers, which in our case, we do.
    - As such, in order to achieve this, we must wrap the function around in an asynchronous arrow function that immediately gets called.

## Additional Notes

- This should require no refactoring on your part. Most, if not, all commands should work exactly as they did before.
- In complete honesty, I'm not even sure if this will really make much of a difference, or if there even are any commands that would break with our old implementation.
- That said, this does seem to be the recommended pattern from Commander, so probably best to do it this way.
