# v1.18.1 (Patch Release)

**Status**: In progress

This is a new patch release of the `alex-c-line` package. It fixes issues with the package in a way that should require no refactoring. Please read below the description of changes.

## Description of Changes

- Prevent `create-pull-request-template` from throwing an error if it couldn't find the config.
    - If there's no config, then flags may be specified instead, so it should not error.

## Additional Notes

- Also turns out that not supplying flags or a config at all (i.e. just doing `alex-c-line create-pull-request-template`) does still give an error. I think the reason why is because `projectType` has no default as of now.
- As such, if you encounter any errors from switching over from `create-pull-request-templates` to `create-pull-request-template` and want the old behaviour still, you can do `alex-c-line create-pull-request-template --project-type package` and it will still work.
- Alternatively, you may specify `projectType: "package"` in your `alex-c-line.config.js` file and it will also work.
